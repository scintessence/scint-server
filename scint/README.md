# Scint Composition

## Architecture and Design

Inspired by Rust and other inheritance-wary paradigms, the heart of Scint is its dynamic approach to composition built on “Structs,” “Traits,” and “entities.” Structs serve not merely as typed containers but also as bounded “actors,” holding state, context, and the potential for behavior. This structure enables a language model’s state to be reflected in a living data construct, allowing AI-derived insights to be stored, transformed, or shared as the system evolves.
